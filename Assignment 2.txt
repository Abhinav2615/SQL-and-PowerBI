-- What do these measures convey about the horsepower and weight of the cars data

-- 1) Approximately 63 percent of the cars made by car manufactures have horsepower below the average horsepower
-- 2) Approximately 56 percent of the cars have weight below the average weight and . there is a high spread of weights of the cars from the mean weight (std deviation is approximately 850 units)
-- 3) Mean and median of accel is approximately same which means accel is normally distributed and also standard deviation is very less(the spread of the accel values is closer to the mean value)
